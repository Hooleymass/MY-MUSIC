# MY-MUSIC
my-music are a set of scripts created by me in order to download YOUTUBE videos easily it's made so that even normies can easily download files without seeing ads or installing malicious apps in a ANDROID smartphone by using only termux.

IT USES OPEN SOURCE TOOLS WHICH ARE FFMPEG & YOUTUBE-DL

The Usage 

Just share the video to termux after installing the SCRIPT

Or type mm in termux rather than that it also has a file converter for video and audio.

One line to install all

cd && rm -rf MY-MUSIC && pkg install git -y && git clone "https://github.com/animegamer4422/MY-MUSIC" && cd MY-MUSIC && chmod +x my-musicinst && termux-setup-storage && bash my-musicinst
